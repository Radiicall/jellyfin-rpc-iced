# Jellyfin-RPC-Iced

This project is trying to add a GUI to [Jellyfin-RPC](https://github.com/radiicall/jellyfin-rpc) using the [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) library.

It's very much WIP but should work just fine.

## Features
- [x] Display Status
- [x] Display Errors
- [x] Config reloading
- [ ] Config editing
- [ ] Have an initial setup (ex. login screen or if i cant figure that out then just fields to enter API key, username, etc.)
- [ ] Tray Icon
- [ ] Theme

## Todo
1. Create working GUI
2. Refactor GUI because its horribly written
